Description: Input latitude and longitude values or an 'sf/sfc' POINT 
    object and get back the timezone in which they exist. Two methods are implemented. 
    One is very fast and uses 'Rcpp' in conjunction with data from the 'Javascript' library
    (<https://github.com/darkskyapp/tz-lookup/>). This method also works outside of countries' 
    borders and in international waters, however speed comes at the cost of accuracy - near time 
    zone borders away from populated centres there is a chance that it will return the incorrect
    time zone. The other method is slower but more accurate - it uses the 'sf' package to intersect 
    points with a detailed map of time zones from here:
