Title: Look Up Time Zones of Point Coordinates
Version: 0.2.0
Authors@R: person("Andy", "Teucher", email = "andy.teucher@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Input latitude and longitude values or an 'sf/sfc' POINT 
    object and get back the timezone in which they exist. Two methods are implemented. 
    One is very fast and uses the 'V8' package to access the 'tz-lookup.js' 'Javascript' library
    (<https://github.com/darkskyapp/tz-lookup/>). This method also works outside of countries' 
    borders and in international waters, however speed comes at the cost of accuracy - near time 
    zone borders away from populated centres there is a chance that it will return the incorrect
    time zone. The other method is slower but more accurate - it uses the sf package to intersect 
    points with a detailed map of time zones from here:
